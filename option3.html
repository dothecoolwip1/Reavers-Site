          <h2>What we actually do on the list</h2>
          <p>
            Red Deer Reavers trains for Buhurt, a form of full contact armored combat.
            Fighters wear full steel armor, use blunted weapons, and fight in teams inside a fenced list.
            The goal is to put the other side on the ground while staying on your own feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is loud, heavy, and tiring, but it is not chaos.
            There are rules, experienced marshals, and a lot of respect between fighters.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Armor and weapons are checked before they enter the list.</li>
            <li>There are clear illegal targets and actions that are not allowed.</li>
            <li>Medical trained people are present at events.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Who shows up to train</h2>
          <p>
            People who train with us come from all kinds of backgrounds.
            Some have done judo, rugby, or lifting.
            Others have never played a contact sport before.
          </p>
          <p>
            The common thread is that everyone wants a serious challenge and a team to belong to,
            but they still have jobs, kids, and busy lives.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adults and older teens who want something different from a regular gym.</li>
            <li>Parents who schedule training around family life.</li>
            <li>People who want to compete or people who just love training in armor.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What your first night looks like</h2>
          <p>
            A lot of people worry they will walk into the gym and be thrown straight into a pile of steel.
            That is not how we run things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your first night is about learning how we move and how we keep things safe.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>We greet you, go over a short waiver, and talk through basic safety.</li>
            <li>You join the warm up at your own pace.</li>
            <li>We pair you with someone experienced for simple movement and balance drills.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy it, you keep coming and we slowly add more contact over time.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How training is split across the week</h2>
          <p>
            The exact days move around with seasons and space, but the structure stays similar.
            One session is more strength and conditioning, and one is more skills and armor time.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>How we handle gear and cost</h2>
          <p>
            A full set of armor can be a big investment.
            We do not expect new people to show up with a full kit or buy everything at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead we think in stages and help you make smart choices so you are not buying things twice.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stage one is soft kit and loaner shields or padded weapons.</li>
            <li>Stage two adds key protection like helmet, neck, and hands.</li>
            <li>Stage three is a full kit built piece by piece as you are ready.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What about injuries and safety</h2>
          <p>
            Any full contact sport carries some risk, and we are honest about that.
            At the same time we do everything we can to keep those risks as low as possible.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We make sure armor fits properly before it sees contact.</li>
            <li>We teach safe falling, posting, and how to tap out if something feels off.</li>
            <li>We avoid people fighting when they are too tired to protect themselves.</li>
          </ul>
